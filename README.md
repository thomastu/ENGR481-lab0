# Overview

The purpose of this notebook is to provide a rough working example of the data engineering required to calculate utility bills from published rates.

At a high level we demonstrates the following:

- How to take a timeseries of building energy use and assign published utility rates from OpenEI's Utility Rate Database
- How to create and visualize a load duration curve
- How to calculate peak demand in the context of a utility bill

This was done in an academic context as a lab exercise taught by Dr. Peter Alstone.
